# Wave 1: CRUD for Two Models

## Goal

Our video store API should be able to work with two entities, `Customer` and `Video`.

Customers are entities that describe a customer at the video store.  They contain:

- name of the customer
- postal code of the customer
- phone number of the customer
- register_at datetime of when the customer was added to the system.

Videos are entities that describe a video at the video store.  They contain:

- title of the video
- release date datetime of when the video was release_date
- total inventory of how many copies are owned by the video store

Our goal for this wave is to be able to do all CRUD actions for these two entities.

## Error Handling Requirements for Every Endpoint

It's crucial for all APIs to be able to handle errors. For every required endpoint described in this project, handle errors in this pattern.

If something goes wrong...
- Your API should return an appropriate HTTP status code.
- For POST and PUT requests, responses with 4XX response codes should also return a response body with some indication of what went wrong.


If something goes wrong...
- Your API should return an appropriate HTTP status code.
- For POST and PUT requests, responses with 4XX response codes should also return a response body with some indication of what went wrong.

This could be something as simple as:

```json
{
        "details": "Invalid data"
}
```

...or something slightly more complex like:
```json
[
   "title must be provided and it must be a string",
   "total_inventory must be provided and it must be a number"
]
```

Some of the tests require a particular response body for 400 levels responses. In other cases, you are free to choose.

# Requirements

Here we will list every endpoint for these entities.

Every endpoint must serve JSON data, and must use HTTP response codes to indicate the status of the request.

1. PUT `/customers/<id>`
1. DELETE `/customers/<id>`

### `GET` `/customers`  details

Lists all existing customers and details about each customer.

#### Required Arguments
